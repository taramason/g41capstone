# Perch App - 

# Description: This is a mobile app that allows you to use two phones to create a baby monitor when you are on the go. Since it requires two phones to operate, I created a simple video so you can watch it in action!  Please take a look at the video here: https://www.screencast.com/t/j6MptUKKt5UG

# Technologies: Ionic2, WebRTC, PeerJS, Cordova.

#How to use: Open the app, and the home screen will display an ID. 
To connect to another phone, type in the ID of the phone (displayed on the homescreen) that you would like to connect to. 
Both phones are now connected to eachother via video. Feel free to watch this video to see it in action! https://www.screencast.com/t/j6MptUKKt5UG
